<h2>Who we are:</h2>
<p>Hi! We are a group of friends from Greenwich, Connecticut who are incoming seniors at Greenwich Academy. We all love food and love instagram, so naturally we decided to start our own food instagram.
 </p>

<h2>A little about our page:</h2>

<p>We try to post for every meal (including dessert) and we post our own pictures that we take while also accepting submissions. Along with this, we read all of our emails and sometimes accept offers from bakeries to advertise for them. We are very particular about who and when we advertise as we do not want this to be the main focus of our account. Weâ€™re all about good food!</p>
